Two types of tasks, so two .txt!
done!

unify genResponse and genResponseRT
done

unify genResponse and genResponseRT for last
done!

=============
use structures for function IO (to make it consice, but not clear)
ignore it for now
SKIPPED!!!

============
1. find out the genTrack() bug for tTrack
done!
2. why Trials(:,7) is only 0 and 1?
done!
3. the 5 and 1 bug is in the touchground(), kill it!
found at last, about kicking the outliers depending on std...

    老师好，
    那个只有记录0?却没有任?的情况的数据的bug已经fixed（请告诉我你的bug的出处）?
    有两个问题想请教?老师?

        上次有被试反应目前的休息间距??0s的Trials之间休息30s）太长，眼睛有点累?可以改为每个Trial后自愿?择（可以休息?0s，也可以不等30s就继续下次的Trial）么？这个休息时间间距如何调呢？

可以在Trial与Trial之间，让被试自己控制休息时间，然后按键?择继续执行程序?如KbWait,以及
下面的DioWait例子（调用该子函数，可能?稍微修改）?用这种函数前，最好前面停顿几秒，然后加载这个函数，并提示
被试休息，按某个键继续?。以防止被试直接就到下一个trial了?
function DioWait
global dioIn
values=getvalue(dioIn);
while sum(values)==2
    values=getvalue(dioIn);
end
return
 
 

        老师说的4*2的实验条件的不平衡，我们通过fullfact (结果如下)的Block给每个被试做，那么会不会造成顺序效应？如 1 1 条件给每个被试?是在 2 1 出现。（我觉得没有问题，还是确认?在改写程序?毕竟是被试内没有重复的顺序）
        可以在这个fullfact基础上，用randperm,使顺序随机?

 

               seq=fullfact([2,4]);

             seq=(seq(randperm(length(seq))',:));
done!

Why MATLAB/linux is crashing everytime, complaining some MEX problem? DotRotDemo() is not crashing it, Octave/GNU is not, neither...
and Windows MATLAB is just all right
?dunno, come to this later!

============
Deadly bug! the experiment is two times longer than it meant to. Fixed immediately, it is in the round() function. Always wrap all the things inside a round(), not parts of the components!
Fixed (as described above!)
Does not seems fixed, at least it seems fucking bad.
Lihan Chen suggested to clear the time tracking in Screen('Flip'): we'd better NOT DO THAT!!!
============
1. Found out that the bug reported above has not been fixed YET!
Fix this!

2. The wangchongM*.mat and chenqifanM*.mat was under different task due to the experimenter's mistake.
Before many_on experiment, they were told to RESPOND "LEFT" TO MANY OF THE 
"RED" DOTS, which is:  MANY RED--> LEFT
         unlike this:  MANY RED--> RIGHT (this is what it should have been.)

  adjust these two *D.mat files!
  read ./data/readme.txt file for more details!
===========
two bugs above not fixed.
all the data files in *M.mat task uses an inverse case as the ones reported above (for integrity)

Gaoxiang/*.mat and majie01-Dec-2012buggy(partial).mat did not finish the last remaining trial, due to a program crash caused by 'indexing problems in genTrack()->adjustTrack()->xTrack
They need to add this little piece!
Done! (run addupLast() for them!)

wrap the candies like ./first
Done!
